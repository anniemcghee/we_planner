# We Planner

We Planner is a simple tool to help couples visualize all of the deadlines, appointments and milestones they need to achieve together before their wedding day.

This app is built in Sails JS with an Angular front end and a Mongo database. I used Timeline JS and an Angular / Timeline directive to structure the app, as well as the Bootstrap Angular Datepicker directive.

My background in fundraising and events got me excited about a timeline app. Presenting it in a wedding context limits the users to two, but I hope to scale this feature for groups and teams that are planning events together.

I loved tackling Angular and hacking away at TimelineJS to make all the pieces work together for my vision.

I'm excited to keep working on it - adding clickable tags and presenting separate timelines for each user are the next steps.
